## Classes and Objects
A class defines the attributes of objects, ie, the information related to them (instance variables), and their commands, ie, their methods. The values of instance (ie, object) variables define the internal state of an individual object, whereas methods define the functionality it offers.
A Method is a piece of source code written inside a class that's been named and has the ability to be called. A method is always part of some class and is often used to modify the internal state of an object instantiated from a class.
As an example, ArrayListis a class offered by Java, and we've made use of objects instantiated from it in our programs. An object is always instantiated by calling a method that created an object, ie, a constructor by using the new keyword.

# The Relationship Between a Class and an Object
A class lays out a blueprint for any objects that are instantiated from it. A class is a blueprint. In other words, it specifies what kinds of objects can be instantiated from it
