### Programming paradigms
- A programming paradigm is a way of thinking about and structuring a program's functionality. Programming paradigms differ from one another, for example in how the program's execution and control are defined and what components the programs consist of.
- Most programming languages ​​that are currently in use support multiple programming paradigms. Part of a programmer's growth involves the ability, through experience, to choose the appropriate programming language and paradigm; there currently is no single ubiquitous programming language and programming paradigm.

- The most common programming paradigms today are object-oriented programming, procedural programming, and functional programming.

## Object-Oriented Programming

In object-oriented programming, information is represented as classes that describe the concepts of the problem domain and the logic of the application. Classes define the methods that determine how information is handled. During program execution, objects are instantiated from classes that contain runtime information and that also have an effect on program execution: program execution typically proceeds through a series of method calls related to the objects. "the program is built from small, clear, and cooperative entities."

- The basic ideas of object-oriented programming, i.e., the representation of information and its processing methods with he help of classes and objects, first appeared in Simula 67, which was designed for developing simulations and the Smalltalk programming language. Its breakthrough came in the 1980s through the C++ programming language and Java has made it one of the most widely used programming paradigms in the world.
- One of the major benefits of object-oriented programming is how problem-domain concepts are modeled through classes and objects, which makes programs easier to understand. In addition, structuring the problem domain into classes facilitates the construction and maintenance of programs. However, object-oriented programming is not inherently suited to all problems: for example, scientific computing and statistics applications typically make use of languages, such as R and Python.
- The object-oriented paradigm is characterized by the use of classes and objects. In object-oriented programming, an object is an instance of a class. A class is a template for an object. An object has its own data, called attributes, and methods, which are functions that operate on the object's data. Objects can interact with one another by passing messages, which are requests to perform an action on an object. The object-oriented paradigm is characterized by the use of classes and objects.

# Procedural programming

Whereas in object-oriented programming, the structure of a program is formed by the data it processes, in procedural programming, the structure of the program is formed by functionality desired for the program: the program acts as a step-by-step guide for the functionality to be performed. The program is executed one step at a time, and subroutines (methods) are called whenever necessary.


In procedural programming, the state of the program is maintained in variables and tables, and any methods handle only the values provided to them as parameters. The program tells the computer what should happen.

When comparing object-oriented programming with procedural programming, a few essential differences emerge. In object-oriented programming, the state of an object can, in principle, change with any object method, and that change of state can also affect the working of the methods of other objects. As a consequence, other aspects of a program's execution may also be affected since objects can be used in multiple places within the program. In procedural programming, the state of the program is maintained in variables and tables, and any methods handle only the values provided to them as parameters. The program tells the computer what should happen.

### Algorithms
- Algorithms, precise instructions on how to to accomplish a specific task, are at the core of computer science. In the context of programming, algorithms are typically defined using source code.
- The concept of efficiency is often associated with algorithms. A programs efficiency, i.e, the computation of required information fast enough, is an integral part of a programs usability. If it took two days for an algorithm designed for forecasting tomorrows weather run, the results wouldn't be very useful! Similarly, a user viewing a TVs program guide won't get any use out of it, if the tv-shows info only loads after the show already ended.
- The most basic algorithm is the one that simply prints out a message to the user. This is a very simple algorithm, but it is the most basic algorithm. It is also the most common algorithm. It is also the most common algorithm.
- An algorithm is a procedure for solving a problem or performing a task. An algorithm is a set of well-defined instructions that can be followed to solve a problem or perform a task. 
- In a more general sense, retrieving and displaying information quickly is an integral part of any applications function. 
## Sorting information
If the information (data) giving to a computer, doesn't follow any rules and isn't in order, retrieving that information is taxing for the computer. We need order! Here comes sorting!
# Selection sort
Every programmer should be familiar with at least one sorting algorithm (i.e a way to sort an array). We should familiarize ourselves with one "classic" sorting algorithm, the selection sort.
